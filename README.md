**_Proposal of idea of using ATM as EVM._**

To solve the problem of having people to vote in their registered residential place who are residing in other places by developing a ubiquitous software where people can Vote in an ATM by abiding confidentiality, integrity, transparency, convenience, and auditability of functional and security requirements.

A web application to use ATM as as Voting machines (EVM) during election time.
We have added special feature for authentication that is the facial recognition and Aadhaar data for validation purposes.
This aplication displays the candidates list of the particular constituency dynamically from his constituency.
Along with the transperancy in the vote process.

**Objectives**
1. Registration
2. Verification
3. Casting
4. Counting/Collation
5. Announcing results
